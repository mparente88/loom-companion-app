The Loom Companion App is inspired by the story Loom, where stuffed animals protect children from their deepest fears and nightmares. This app allows users to create and manage their own characters within the Loom universe, customizing stuffed animal companions that guard their Person (a child) from various nightmares.

Built as a full-stack application, the Loom Companion App features its own working API and front-end tools that provide full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionality. Users can create profiles for their children, design stuffed animals, and track the child's fears, all while seamlessly managing data through a user-friendly interface.

## User Stories
